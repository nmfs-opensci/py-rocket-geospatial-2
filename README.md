# py-rocket-geospatial v2.0

This creates a base Python-R image with geospatial packages for Python and R. The Python environment is the Pangeo notebook environment + extra geospatial libraries (similar to CryoCloud). The R environment is Rocker geospatial plus a few other packages. The image also includes a linux Desktop with QGIS, CoastWatch Utilities, and Panoply.

TeXLive and Quarto are installed along with MyST and JupyterBook.

Python 3.11 is installed with a conda environment called notebook that is activated on opening the container. R 4.5.X is installed and operates separate from the conda notebook environment (conda is not on the PATH when using R). R can be used from RStudio or JupyterLab and the same R environment is used.

* [R packages]()

## Structure

* The base infrastructure (Jupyter, Dask, Python install, conda env, R install, all the set ups around the user experience) are in [py-rocket-base](https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/py-rocket-base/). See the  [py-rocket-base documentation](https://nmfs-opensci.github.io/py-rocket-base/) for information on the base image structure and design.
* py-rocket-geospatial-2 the Python scientific core packages and Python and R geospatial packages. Note the R core scientific packages are in py-rocket-base since rocker_verse is the base R.
* py-rocket-geospatial-2 also installs QGIS, CoastWatch Utilities, and Panoply.

### Customizing py-rocket-geospatial-2

1. You can create a derivative image using py-rocket-geospatial-2 as the base. This will add packages to the conda and R environments.
```
FROM ghcr.io/nmfs-opensci/container-images/py-rocket-geospatial-2:2026.02.08

USER root

COPY . /tmp/
RUN /pyrocket_scripts/install-conda-packages.sh /tmp/environment.yml || echo "install-conda-packages.sh failed" || true
RUN /pyrocket_scripts/install-r-packages.sh /tmp/install.R || echo "install-r-package.sh failed" || true
RUN rm -rf /tmp/*

USER ${NB_USER}
WORKDIR ${HOME}
```

2. You can use the https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/py-rocket-geospatial-2/Dockerfile as a template.

3. Making your derivative image build automatically in GitHub.
   - Copy `action.yaml` to the base of your repo
   - Copy `.github/workflows/build-and-push.yml` into your repo and edit the `image-name`.
   - Set up your repo to allow packages to be published to your location from your repo.

## Provenance

This image used to live at https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/container-images/tree/main/images/py-rocket-geospatial-2 but has now been moved to a dedicated directory. https://github.com/nmfs-opensci/container-images contains other derivative images used in NMFS OpenSci JupyterHubs.
